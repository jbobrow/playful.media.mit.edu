"\" with, many people (and businesses) prefer a more professional approach. "
"Because of this, this mode contains only the more business appropriate "
"greetings such as \"Hello\", \"Aloha\" and \"Konnichiwa\". The full list can "

"field labeled as \"Custom Word List\". Make sure each word/phrase has no "

"\"Custom word list\" and adds it to our default list of words and phrases. "
"2) \"Custom list only\", this mode takes what you enter into the \"Custom "
"word list\" and uses that as the entire list.</p>"
